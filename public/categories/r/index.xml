      <description>Unless you follow mid-major conferences closely, when it comes time to picking first round upsets in the NCAA Tournament you’re likely either picking teams at random, or going off the analysis of the “experts” on TV, the internet, or podcasts. I won’t address those who pick their upsets and Cinderella teams at random here, instead this post is about those who combine whatever they know about the field in a given year with what they see, read, and hear in the media.</description>

      <description>The content of this post nearly became a Stack Overflow question. In the process of going about making a reproducible example I solved the problem, as often happens. It took a bit of time to stich together several other SO posts before I arrived at it. Hopefully when someone else comes across the issue maybe this will provide some immediate assistance.
The following is the reprex I went about writing to include in the Stack Overflow post.</description>
