      <description>Introduction Ensemble methods (random forests, gradient boosting machines) have proven to be a winning strategy on Kaggle1. The building blocks of those methods are decision trees, which are generally well understood. It can seem, however, that the ensembling of many trees can produce a sort of magic that allows it to achieve much better performance than a single tree.
When learning about these methods the discussion moves quickly from declaring them an ensemble of trees into a discussion of hyperparameter tuning, glossing over exactly how or why boosting works so well.</description>
