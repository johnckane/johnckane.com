      <description>The content of this post nearly became a Stack Overflow question. In the process of going about making a reproducible example I solved the problem, as often happens. It took a bit of time to stich together several other SO posts before I arrived at it. Hopefully when someone else comes across the issue maybe this will provide some immediate assistance.
The following is the reprex I went about writing to include in the Stack Overflow post.</description>

      <description>import numpy as np np.random.randn(10) What I want to provide perhaps a google search result for someone who discovers they did the same thing I did and hope that they may be able to recover them.
For most of 2017 I have worked on a project and stored the files locally, not doing version control with git. As the project matured I realized I would soon need to share the code and to make use of all git has to offer, I should connect it to a repository.</description>

      <description>Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.
Bool True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do.</description>

      <description>Part One One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
 He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
 The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</description>

      <title>Use @ instead of HEAD</title>

      <description>I recently discovered that from git version 1.8.5 onwards, @ can replace HEAD:
$ git reset --hard @~2 $ git rebase -i @~10 $ git diff @~2..@~3  And also in most scenarios HEAD can be left out completely, so you can say:
$ git reset -- @{2}  instead of:
$ git reset -- HEAD@{2}  It takes some getting used to, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely faster than typing HEAD.</description>

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugo—a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
