      <description>The content of this post nearly became a Stack Overflow question. In the process of going about making a reproducible example I solved the problem, as often happens. It took a bit of time to stich together several other SO posts before I arrived at it. Hopefully when someone else comes across the issue maybe this will provide some immediate assistance.
The following is the reprex I went about writing to include in the Stack Overflow post.</description>

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugoâ€”a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
