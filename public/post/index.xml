      <description>Most years filling out my NCAA Tournament bracket I work forwards through the games. I select the winners of the first round games then, using an ever dwindling pool of teams, proceed all the way through to selecting a champion. The later round games are worth more points in bracket pools so you can really hinder your prospects of winning if you donâ€™t at least have an eye on the later rounds of the tournament early on.</description>

      <description>Introduction Ensemble methods (random forests, gradient boosting machines) have proven to be a winning strategy on Kaggle1. The building blocks of those methods are decision trees, which are generally well understood. It can seem, however, that the ensembling of many trees can produce a sort of magic that allows it to achieve much better performance than a single tree.
When learning about these methods the discussion moves quickly from declaring them an ensemble of trees into a discussion of hyperparameter tuning, glossing over exactly how or why boosting works so well.</description>
