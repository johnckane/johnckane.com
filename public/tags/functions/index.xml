      <description>The content of this post nearly became a Stack Overflow question. In the process of going about making a reproducible example I solved the problem, as often happens. It took a bit of time to stich together several other SO posts before I arrived at it. Hopefully when someone else comes across the issue maybe this will provide some immediate assistance.
The following is the reprex I went about writing to include in the Stack Overflow post.</description>
